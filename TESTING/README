### TESTING FOR INTERPRETER, TAC_GENERATION and MIPS_GENERATION ###

* File "TESTS.in" outlines the tests that were used for the testing
* File "TESTS_CONTROL_EXPANDED.in" outlines the control test 
cases where the program is not easily read.
* Files "solutions.out" found in the sub directories 
for interpreter, tac and mips outline the results of the compiler
when their respective shell script is run.
* File "solutions.in" in the "interpreter_solutions" directory shows the
expected results of the interpreter(used for correctness testing)
* To run the shell scripts you need to change the directories inside the .sh
to match your current ones
